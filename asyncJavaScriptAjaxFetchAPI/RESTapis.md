# REST APIs 
## What does REST mean and why is it useful?
### REST stands for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
- REST is normal people words is an **architecture style for designing networked applications** 
- REST relies on stateless, client-server protocol, which is pretty much always HTTP
- It treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed 

### Cool, so we have a *general* understanding of what REST means. Chances are if you've used a public API in the last decade, it's a REST API. Why's that you ask?
### Since REST uses just HTTP requests and a standard (ex. JSON), it can be **used with any programming language**.

## API is the messenger and REST uses HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to format that message. 

### Here are some common HTTP Requests
- GET: Retrieve data
- POST: Submit data
- PUT: Update data
- DELETE: Delete data
### These are less common but worth knowing
- HEAD: same as GET but only returns a header, no body
- OPTIONS: returns the supported HTTP methods
- PATCH: update partial resources
