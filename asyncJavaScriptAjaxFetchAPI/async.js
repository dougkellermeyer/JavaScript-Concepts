//lets go over what asynchronous code is and how it differs from synchronous code

//asynchronous or async code doesn't have to wait for a request or function to finish to run the next function or section of code

//AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And Xml)- set of web tech that sends and recieves data asynchronously. Doesn't interfere with the current page. 
//-> ironically enough, although XML is part of the AJAX acronym, XML is rarely used today - it's nearly always JSON

//There are other ways to make HTTP requests
//-Fetch API (comes for free in vanilla JS), Axios, Superagent, jQuery, Node HTTP
